# creditRisk
This is a basic implementation of my Credit Risk model.  It depends on my <a href="https://github.com/phillyfan1138/FangOost">FangOost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/phillyfan1138/FunctionalUtilities">Functional Utilities</a> repositories.  It also depends on the <a href="https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson">rapidjson</a> repository.  It expects these repos to be cloned in the same directory as this repo.
